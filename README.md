Welcome to you. 

My name is Eloi Str√©e.
I am programmer with a bad lifestyle habbit and a high will to procrastination for topic outside programming and games.

But as I don't want to die at 50 year old because my bad habbits.
I want to learn how to cook "healthy" storable food when my second brain ask me food. 

So if you are in the same situation as me feel free to check my cook book.



PS: I only follow one rule: 
"The best way to not cook meat is to not learn to cook meat"

Not vegan, but there are numerous debat around ecology, economy, moral, heatlh, price ...
So, for "fun", I imposed me this rule.


On that good reading and good cooking you.
